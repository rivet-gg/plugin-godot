### Enabling support for symbolic links on windows

This repository relies on use of symbolic links in order to re-use the `addons/rivet/` folder inside of `examples/*/addons/rivet/`.

If you don't files in the folder `examples/*/addons/rivet/`, do the following:

**Enable developer mode**

1. Open _Settings_
2. Navigate to _Updates & Security > For Developers_
3. Enable _Developer Mode_

**Enable symlinks in Git**

1. Delete the `plugin-godot` folder
2. Download and run the Git installer (even if Git is already installed)
3. Uncheck _Only show new options_ at the bottom of the window
4. Click _Next_ until you see the _Configuring extra options_ screen
5. Check _Enable symbolic links_
6. Finish the installation
7. Re-clone the repository. You should see files under `examples/*/addons/rivet/`.
